# AcidBaseGameDevelopment

### Objective
The purpose of the Acid-Base Game project is to create a digital educational tool that effectively teaches players about the fundamental concepts of acids and bases through engaging and interactive gameplay. This project aims to bridge the gap between educational content and entertainment, making learning about chemistry appealing and accessible to a broad audience, particularly middle and high school students. The game is designed not only to educate but also to stimulate interest in chemistry by presenting scientific principles in a fun, interactive format that encourages learning through play.

### Overview
The Acid-Base Game is a 2D interactive educational game developed using the Godot Engine. It is designed to teach players about the basics of acid-base reactions through a series of game levels, each with increasing complexity and incorporating different aspects of acid-base chemistry. Players control a character who must defend against attacks from an opposing character, a duck, who shoots either acids or bases. The player's goal is to neutralize these attacks by selecting the appropriate chemical (either an acid or a base) from multiple choice options. The game consists of four levels: In Level 1, the duck shoots acids, and players must select the correct base to neutralize the attack. Level 2 switches roles with the duck shooting bases, requiring players to choose the correct acid. In Level 3, the duck randomly shoots either acids or bases, demanding quick and accurate responses from players. The final challenge, Level 4, involves predicting the products of acid-base reactions. Players earn points for correct answers and lose lives for incorrect ones, needing at least a 70% success rate to advance to the next level.

### Functional Requirements
- The game must include four distinct levels, each progressively increasing in difficulty and complexity, designed to enhance the player's understanding of acid-base reactions.
- Each of the four levels must contain exactly ten questions, ensuring a consistent and balanced gameplay experience across all stages.
- Players must answer at least 7 out of 10 questions correctly to advance to the next level. This requirement is intended to ensure that players have adequately grasped the concepts before moving on.
- The game should dynamically increase the speed of questions once the player completed answering five questions during any level, adding an element of challenge, and keeping the gameplay engaging.
- Upon successful completion of each level, players should receive a reward, such as points, badges, or unlocking additional content, to motivate continued play and learning.
- Players will start with a predefined number of lives, and one life will be deducted for each incorrect answer to instill a sense of consequence and encourage careful thinking.
- Each level should begin with a brief tutorial that explains the unique mechanics and goals of the level, ensuring players are well-prepared for the challenges ahead.
- Questions for each level should be randomly selected from a pool of 50 total questions stored in the game's database. This ensures a varied and unpredictable gameplay experience each time.
- Players should be able to pause the game and resume from the exact point they left off, providing flexibility and convenience, especially in a mobile gaming environment.
- The game must immediately inform players if their answers are correct or incorrect and provide brief informative feedback to reinforce learning or correct misunderstandings.
- During gameplay, a pop-up should appear with multiple-choice answers for each question, allowing players to select their response, thus facilitating an interactive and engaging user interface.
- A tutorial option should be easily accessible from the main menu and each level's start screen, allowing new players or those needing a refresher to access instructional content at any time.
- The graphical representation of chemical compounds in the game must be large enough to be easily readable on various devices, enhancing accessibility and user engagement.
- The game's user interface should be continuously reviewed and enhanced to improve aesthetic appeal and usability, ensuring a seamless and enjoyable player experience.
- The game should incorporate various elements such as storylines, character development, and advanced gameplay features to maintain and enhance player engagement over time.
